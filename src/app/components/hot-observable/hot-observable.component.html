<h2>Hot Observable</h2>

<p>Unlike cold observables, hot observables emit data regardless of the presence of subscribers. 
    Subscribing to a hot observable means the subscriber will receive the current item being emitted, 
    not from the start.
</p>

<p>WebSocket connections are an example of hot observables. A WebSocket connection is established once 
    and shared among multiple subscribers.</p>
